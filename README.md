# Hyperparameter Tuning

This branch contains code for hyperparameter tuning using Random Search CV for two popular regression models, XGBoost and RandomForest. The goal is to improve the performance of these models by selecting the best hyperparameters using cross-validation.

## Conclusion
This branch provides a starting point for hyperparameter tuning using Random Search CV for XGBoost and RandomForest regressors. You can use this code as a template for tuning hyperparameters for other regression models as well.
