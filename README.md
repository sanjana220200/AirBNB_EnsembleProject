# Ensemble Learning project - DSBA ESSEC & Centrale Sup√©lec

## New York City Airbnb Price Prediction
This project is focused on predicting the prices of Airbnb listings in New York City based on various features available in the dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes approximately 47,000 listings with 15 features on each listing, such as neighborhood, price, review information, and availability.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to explore and analyze the dataset, perform feature engineering to extract useful information, and use various machine learning and ensemble learning algorithms to predict the prices of Airbnb listings in New York City.

## Files Included
The following files are included in this project:

1) Airbnb_Data_Analysis_and_Price_Prediction_Final.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation.

2) data/AB_NYC_2019.csv: This is the original dataset obtained from Kaggle.
